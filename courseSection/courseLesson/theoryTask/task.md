This is an example of a theory lesson.

<div class="hint" title="What is the difference between visible and invisible files?">
  
You can use hints to explain something to the students. 
Please leave an empty line to be able to apply markdown formatting, like **this**.

Invisible files are hidden in the student mode. 
You can use them to define, for example, the helper functions in the course.

To mark a file as invisible, you need to set up the `false` value for the corresponding file in the [task-info](./task-info.yaml) file.
</div>

Theory tasks do not contain any tests.
